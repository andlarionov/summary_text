People and expertise  
More than two-fifths of the institutions who responded to the survey employ experts  
with  knowledge  or  qualifications  in  behavioural  sciences.  This  investment  suggests  a  certain   commitment   to   using   behavioural   insights,   with   specialist   resources   and  incorporating them into the work of the organisations.  
In-house expertise exists side by side with partnerships with think-tanks, universities  and  research  institutions  which  support  public  organisations  in  applying  behavioural  insights.   Inudgeyou   working   with   the   Danish   Business   Authority,   Konrad   Lorenz  University  Institute  in  partnership  with  the  Colombian  Communications  Regulator,  Harvard  Business  School  and  the  Mayor  of  Boston  or  the  UK  Financial  Conduct  Authority with University College London are only some of the examples of government  and research institutions working together in the survey.  
These  partnerships  can  provide  the  necessary  technical  expertise  that  government  does not have and might not need to acquire as long as it has the capacity to (i) identify  potential areas for applications, (ii) decide who outside government is most appropriate to  do the job, and (iii) evaluate the results and transfer them to policy making. The technical  expertise on designing and running experiments can be quite easily outsourced. The job  of government should be increasingly focused on the next steps and in particular how to  move from often small-scale experiments to the design of policies that can be applied on  a real scale.
